Fundamental functionality required by all other modules.

The functionality of the module include

* the main sgpp::base::Grid class
* different types of sparse grids (with or without grid points on the boundary etc.)
* different types of basis functions (piecewise linear/polynomial, B-splines, pre-wavelets, â€¦)
* the underlying data structures
* data types (sgpp::base::DataVector and sgpp::base::DataMatrix)
* basic operations such as hierarchization and dehierarchization
* evaluation and evaluation at multiple data points
* adaptive refinement
* refinement specified via functors
* quadrature
* basic OpenMP support
