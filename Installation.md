Select your operating system and compiler to get instructions.

SG++ can also be used with other OS/compiler combinations that are not listed here. SG++ should at least work with GCC, Clang, or ICC on Linux, GCC on OSX, and MinGW on Windows.

If you want to use SG++ with MATLAB, we recommend to use the binaries provided in the Downloads and Version History page (see installation instructions on the MATLAB binaries page). There are also other options, if you do not want or are not able to use the binaries (in this case, proceed as explained on the page for your platform).

* [Linux (GCC/Clang/ICC)](https://github.com/SGpp/SGpp/wiki/Linux-(GCC-Clang-ICC))
* OSX (GCC/ICC)
* Windows (MinGW)
* MATLAB binaries
